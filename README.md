## Abstract

The Sports Club Management System (SCMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the administrative tasks and operations of sports clubs. Developed using PHP, the system provides a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of club activities.

SCMS facilitates the direct storage and real-time access of member records by the admin, eliminating the need for intermediary services. It handles the storage of member details, including health status, payment records, and exercise routines for those who have joined the sports club. With the advent of the World Wide Web, club owners have increasingly moved to digital systems for easy access to user details and to ensure they can retrieve necessary information efficiently.

The SCMS enhances communication within the club community by providing messaging functionalities. Members can interact with each other, receive important announcements from administrators, and stay informed about upcoming events through the platform. Overall, the SCMS in PHP serves as a centralized platform for efficiently managing the various administrative tasks involved in running a sports club. Its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features contribute to enhancing the overall effectiveness and organization of club operations.
